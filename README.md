Hackers' Pub is an ActivityPub-enabled social network for hackers.
You can think of it as a federated version of DEV Community (또는 연합판
velog, または連合できるQiita) with a Mastodon-like timeline.

It focuses on the following features:[^1]

 -  Federated via ActivityPub: You can follow and interact with users on other
    servers that support ActivityPub, such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Akkoma.

 -  Markdown with extensions: You can write posts and comments in Markdown with
    extensions, such as tables, footnotes, callouts, diagrams, math, and more.

 -  Powerful code blocks: You can write code blocks with syntax highlighting,
    highlighting lines, focusing lines, diff highlighting, and more.

 -  Multilingual: You can write posts in many languages, not just English.
    You don't speak Chinese or Spanish? No problem! Hackers' Pub supports
    automatic translation of posts and comments.

 -  Algorithmic timeline: You can see posts from users you follow in a
    timeline. The timeline is sorted by the relevance of the posts by default,
    but you can change the sorting order to the latest if you want.

Hackers' Pub is open source.  The source code is available under the AGPL-3.0.

[^1]: Of course, these features are not implemented yet.  This is just a plan.
